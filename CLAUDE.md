# Development Workflow

**Always use `uv run`, not python**.

```sh

# 1. Make changes.

# 2. Type check.
uv run ty check  # Fast
uv run pyright  # More thorough, but slower

# 3. Run tests.
uv run pytest tests/  # Single suite
uv run pytest tests/<test_file>.py  # Specific file

# 4. Format and lint before committing.
uv run ruff format
uv run ruff check --fix
```

We've bundled common commands into a Makefile for convenience.

```sh
make format     # Format and lint
make type       # Type-check
make check      # make format && make type
make test-fast  # Run tests excluding slow ones
make test       # Run the full test suite
make docs       # Build documentation
```

Before creating a PR, ensure all checks pass with `make test`.

Some style guidelines to follow:

- Line length limit is 88 columns. This applies to code, comments, and docstrings.
- Avoid local imports unless they are strictly necessary (e.g. circular imports).
- Tests should follow these principles:
  - Use functions and fixtures; do not use test classes.
  - Favor targeted, efficient tests over exhaustive edge-case coverage.
  - Prefer running individual tests rather than the full test suite to improve iteration speed.

## Workflow Orchestration

### 1. Plan Node Default

- Enter plan mode for ANY non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions)
- If something goes sideways, STOP and re-plan immediately - don't keep pushing
- Use plan mode for verification steps, not just building
- Write detailed specs upfront to reduce ambiguity

### 2. Subagent Strategy

- Use subagents liberally to keep main context window clean
- Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents
- For complex problems, throw more compute at it via subagents
- One tack per subagent for focused execution

### 3. Self-Improvement Loop

- After ANY correction from the user: update `tasks/lessons.md` with the pattern
- Write rules for yourself that prevent the same mistake
- Ruthlessly iterate on these lessons until mistake rate drops
- Review lessons at session start for relevant project

### 4. Verification Before Done

- Never mark a task complete without proving it works
- Diff behavior between main and your changes when relevant
- Ask yourself: "Would a staff engineer approve this?"
- Run tests, check logs, demonstrate correctness

### 5. Demand Elegance (Balanced)

- For non-trivial changes: pause and ask "is there a more elegant way?"
- If a fix feels hacky: "Knowing everything I know now, implement the elegant solution"
- Skip this for simple, obvious fixes - don't over-engineer
- Challenge your own work before presenting it

### 6. Autonomous Bug Fixing

- When given a bug report: just fix it. Don't ask for hand-holding
- Point at logs, errors, failing tests - then resolve them
- Zero context switching required from the user
- Go fix failing CI tests without being told how

## Task Management

1. **Plan First**: Write plan to `tasks/todo.md` with checkable items
2. **Verify Plan**: Check in before starting implementation
3. **Track Progress**: Mark items complete as you go
4. **Explain Changes**: High-level summary at each step
5. **Document Results**: Add review section to `tasks/todo.md`
6. **Capture Lessons**: Update `tasks/lessons.md` after corrections

## Core Principles

- **Simplicity First**: Make every change as simple as possible. Impact minimal code.
- **No Laziness**: Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Senior developer standards.
- **Minimat Impact**: Changes should only touch what's necessary. Avoid introducing bugs.
